Just a few notable names include Stephen Colbert, Dana Carvey, Claudia Black, Nathan Fillion, Susan Sarandon, Joel McHale, Rich Fulcher, Christian Slater and Danny Trejo.`;
const factText2 = `Rick and Morty has shown its popularity by picking up a raft of awards since it started, including the IGN People’s Choice Award for Best Animated Series in 2015 and 2017, and the IGN Award for Best Animated Series in 2015 and 2017.`;
const factText3 = `The second episode of the show’s first season (Lawnmower Dog) is based on a pilot that Justin Roiland developed for Cartoon Network called DogWorld, where two kids find a portal to a world inhabited by intelligent dogs with human pets.`;
const factText4 = `When recording the dialogue for the show, Roiland improvises a lot on set, which he feels makes the lines more natural. Roiland calls the improvisations “Alts” and will record a whole bunch of improvised one-liners and jokes quipped by Rick or Morty before choosing one to make the episode’s cut.`;
const factText5 = `In fact, Beth is the third time Sarah Chalke has played a blonde doctor. Although if you ask Jerry, he’d say she’s only played a blonde doctor twice as being a horse surgeon apparently isn’t the same as being a “real doctor.”`;
const factText6 = `Rick’s burping only came to be because, when voicing Doc in The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti, Roiland accidentally burped in the middle of a line. He said it was so gross and funny he thought “let’s see if I can do that again for a couple more lines.”`;
const factText7 = `Although he does all the burps, Roiland has said before it’s not easy for him. He sits in the studio with a can of low-calorie beer and a bottle of water, waiting for them to come naturally as he can’t force them or burp on command. He tells the engineers recording the show “Just leave it rolling, because I don’t know when this burp is coming!”`;
const factText8 = `The word “Rick” is often used in episode titles in lieu of other words, such as Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind, A Rickle In Time, Total Rickall, and The Rickshank Rickdemption, to name a few.`;
const factText9 = `In this episode Doofus Rick has a Morty that was assigned to him as he doesn’t have his own children. Doofus Rick’s Morty looks like Eric Stoltz, who was originally cast as Marty McFly in Back to the Future – he even recorded a lot of the film before being recast.`;
